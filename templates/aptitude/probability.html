        <h1>Probability Questions</h1>

        <!-- Question 1 -->
        <div class="question-box">
            <h3>1. A die is rolled once. What is the probability of getting a number greater than 4?</h3>
            <button class="cta" onclick="toggleSolution('solution1')">Show Answer</button>
            <div class="solution" id="solution1">
                <p>The possible outcomes for rolling a die are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The numbers greater than 4 are {5, 6}, so the probability is 2/6 = 1/3.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <div class="question-box">
            <h3>2. A bag contains 4 red balls, 5 green balls, and 6 blue balls. What is the probability of drawing a green ball?</h3>

            <div class="solution" id="solution2">
                <p>The total number of balls is 4 + 5 + 6 = 15. The probability of drawing a green ball is 5/15 = 1/3.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 3 -->
        <div class="question-box">
            <h3>3. Two coins are tossed. What is the probability of getting at least one head?</h3>

                <p>There are 13 spades and 4 kings in a deck. However, the king of spades is counted twice, so the total number of favorable outcomes is 13 + 4 - 1 = 16. The probability is 16/52 = 4/13.</p>
